Project Notes

-Working on including a "belt" at the bottom where the footer moves with the rest of the page when scrolling down
and eventually breaks off and turns into a fixed footer when the user scrolls past a certain point

-Emphasize the "rustic" and "wood" look. Take design notes from woodworking, leather working, etc.
